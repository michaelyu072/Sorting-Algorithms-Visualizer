# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
# This is my first python project done independently without following tutorials on Youtube
A program which visualizes merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort on an array of integers

This program requires Python and Pygame installed to run

When you run the program, a display window pops up with a randomly sorted array of integers represented as rectanglesYou can press ENTER to use selection sort, SPACE to use merge sort, and Q to use quick sort on the data

You can press C to clear the space and create a new unsorted array when there is no algorithm running

You can change the number of elements in the array by going to the source code and changing the 'n' variable at the top of the code

Please note that since selection sort is a relatively slow sorting algorithm, you would have to wait much longer for the algorithm to complete

While an algorithm is in progress, the only way to terminate the program is to exit the display window
